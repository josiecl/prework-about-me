at least the first <div>s are organized incorrectly
-"img class" missing initial "<" at beginning and ">" at end
-"<div class="row text-center">" incorrectly inputted (whole <div> of this section needs redoing) for color changing
-for favorite things: forgot <li> and </li> before all the inputs
-for growth and shrink: the end </div> was in the wrong place
-for button changing colors, the "text(color)" didn't match the colors wanted
-<div> was in wrong place for button pressing


Logic Errors:
-forgot to record, but a lot of stuff was missing quotation marks. Some things were incorrectly indented. There was nothing that needed major changing.
